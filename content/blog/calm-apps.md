description: "My list of calm apps."

I spend a _lot_ of time on my digital devices â€“ probably too much for my own good, but partly because as a software engineer, it's difficult not to.

In the last couple of months, I started to notice which apps I enjoy using, which apps enable me to be productive, and generally make me feel _good_. The apps don't have tons of common in their UI or what they are for, but they all have one thing in common â€“ the goal is not to maximize profits, the goal is to solve _a_ thing, do it well, and don't try to do _everything_ and after using them, I feel often _calmer_ than before I opened them.

This is my list of apps that I genuinely like and I'm mostly aligned with the creators:

### Obsidian

Obsidian has become my primary note-taking app, my to-do list, my reading list...you get the idea. The app is extensible, but I don't feel overwhelmed when using it (although the amount of options can be overwhelming initially). Compared to so many CEOs out there jumping from one hype to another, [Obsidian's CEO writes about calmness being a superpower](https://stephango.com/calmness).

While the macOS app is truly amazing and I mostly have no notes there, the iOS app feels janky at times. But since Obsidian is a file-based app, maybe we'll see some enthusiastic devs rewriting a compatible app that feels more native?

And yes, I wrote this blog post in Obsidian ðŸ˜‰

### NetNewsWire

If there is one example of an app that does one thing and does it extremely well, it must be [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/). An open-source RSS reader that doesn't change a ton and you know what? I love that.

### Signal

One thing that would be common across the apps listed here and that brings me the calmness when using them is privacy. I want the apps I use to be local-first and when âœ¨ the internet âœ¨ needs to be involved, my data better be really well encrypted.

Sure, Signal might not have fancy animations and features like Telegram, but I found out I actually don't care. I want my messages to be safe and I want to focus on the one thing I'm in the app for: chatting with people. I don't want an app that tries to keep me engaged at all costs. I want to spend as little time as possible in the app, so I can get on with my day.

#### FlyLeaf

I started to use [FlyLeaf](https://moehrenzahn.de/project/flyleaf) relatively recently. Before I was using Pocket and it was _fine_ but I never got to really liking the app. FlyLeaf is a project of passion with focus on the best experience of _reading articles_ and it's amazing at that. Yoiu get the theme at this point, right? On to the last one.

#### Ivory

Last but not least, my favorite Mastodon client, Ivory. I used Tapbot before Twitter became what it is and Ivory has been perfect. Developed by a small, but mighty team, the app really sets the bar for what timeline-based, native apps shoud look like.

#### More calm apps

I hope non-intrusive apps that let you focus will be more and more the norm. It's so easy today to get distracted and choosing the right or wrong apps can definitely make a dent in your well-being. That being said, the best way to spend one's free time is off the screen, so let me log off now ðŸ˜´
