A lot of developers seem to be mostly reading blog posts only and I think this is a shame.

While blog posts are a great source for learning, they can not really explain some more complicated topics
with a level of detail that books do.

I hope this reading list can be an inspiration for others what to read - but it still is _my_ reading list,
so this list will not be limited to software topics only (hey, we are not only developers but humans, too!)

I'll also write some personal insights for some of the books I really like üñ§

You can check all of them at one place [here](/category/books/)
