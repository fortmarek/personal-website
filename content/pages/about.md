Hi! My name is Marek Fořt and I am thrilled to have you here 🙂

I am currently a production engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I have passion for open-source, Swift, building _stuff_ ✨ - but most importantly of all, helping and talking with people!
At the moment, I am living in Prague, so if you ever happen to visit this beautiful city, feel free to approach me and we can have a chat over coffee ☕️

Otherwise, I am fairly active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/marekfort) and of course you can reach me via [email](marekfort@me.com), too! I am more than happy to talk about anything, it does not have to be Swift or even development-related 🖤

I try to work in the open as much as I can - you could checkout my [Github](https://github.com/fortmarek/) to see what I am working on.
The project I am most active in is [tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) which is a great tool extracting away complexities of Xcode projects,
letting you focus on actually building your apps.

This project has been a great source of inspiration for me, now I am a proud core maintainer of this repository that was founded by [Pedro](https://twitter.com/pedropbuendia/)
who is a great person and I have learnt a lot from him.

_I also like to have fun._
