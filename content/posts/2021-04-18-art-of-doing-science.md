[Art of Doing Science and Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178) is mainly meant for researchers in science or engineering spheres but is a great read even if you are not a researcher (which I am not). While some parts of the book do go into some of the more complicated topics of physics, most of the book is understandable without having deep knowledge of it.

Here are some notes I have gathered over the course of reading this book:

- The main flaw of APL language: it has no redundancy. People do require some redundancy, though.
- "I believe very likely in the future we will have vehicles exploring the surface of Mars. The distance between Earth and Mars at times may be so lrhe the signaling time round-trip could be 20 or more minutes. In the exploration process the vehicle must, therefore, have a fair degree of local control." This is exactly how it went down!
- Geometry course can be thought of as teachers putting programs into us.
- ISBN has the first symbol to check whether the rest of the code is right using weighted sum. With this it can be checked right when someone types if the code is right. This means the system has a tight feedback loop.
- Two theories can explain the same thing and agree on the same details since only their form is different (quantum mechanics wave-particle duality).
- Optimising a component of a system can hinder the performance of the system as a whole â†’ we should not think of how to make the more concrete thing better. Even though this is hard because thinking about the whole system is very abstract.
